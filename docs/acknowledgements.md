## Acknowledgements

Like so many projects, this effort has roots in many places. Special thanks to [John Albin](https://www.drupal.org/u/johnalbin) and many at DrupalCon NOLA 2016 for their work on making component-based theming a reality. Thanks to Phase 2's [Pattern Lab Starter](https://github.com/phase2/pattern-lab-starter), which served as an inspiration and guide in building this project. And finally, thanks of course to the [Pattern Lab team](http://patternlab.io/#credits) for a fantastic tool.
